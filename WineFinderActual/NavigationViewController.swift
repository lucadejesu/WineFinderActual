import UIKit
// Made this class by adding the new cocoa touch class to the project folder
// Then, to connect the class to the controller in storyboard:
// 1. Go to the identity inspector, and specify it as the base class for the scene
class NavigationViewController: UINavigationController
{

    // There is no code here as nothing needed to be added, but in case of future changes ive kept the class as its connected to the navigation controller in storyboard.
