# WineFinderActual

This is an iOS application that will assist in finding wines at the grocery store. The user will request a wine based on various descriptors. Wine review data
will be used to filter search results, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews. After the intial search results, if the user does not
want any of the wines recommended, then the user can click "find a different wine". From there, a machine learning algorithm will recommend a new wine,
based on the unwanted wine in question.
